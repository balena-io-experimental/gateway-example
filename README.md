# gateway-example
very simple dependent device gateway example

This example interacts with the supervisor dependent device API to provision and update some mock dependent devices, it needs to be integrated with an adaptor module before it can work with a real dependent device.

Depends on:
* https://github.com/resin-io/resin-api/pull/622
* https://github.com/resin-io/resin-supervisor/pull/508
